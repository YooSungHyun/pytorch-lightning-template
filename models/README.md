# Example models

We have 2 concept model

## 1. dense model

**I use all of pytorch-lightning⚡'s class as much as i can**

Custom Dataloader, Custom Dataset, LightningDataModule and also you can use Custom DataSampler (if you have one...)

If you want to perfect set of lightning template. PLZ watch this model and paste it!

## 2. rnn model

**Just Look Simply as much as i can**

I just use torch style format.

If you have to make something very quickly and simply, PLZ watch this model and paste it!

ALSO, you want to use pytorch-lightning⚡ style **BPTT** in rnn model, watch this too
